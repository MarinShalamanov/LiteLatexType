# LiteLatexType
Write LaTeX formulas as fast as on paper. 

Sometimes you need to type a math formula fast and writing LaTeX seems like to much effort. To write a fraction in LaTeX you need to type
```
\frac{a}{b}
```
instead of just
```
a/b
```

LiteLatexType handles this and many more problems allowing you to type LaTeX as fast as writing on paper.

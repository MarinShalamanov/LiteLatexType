# LiteLatexType
Write LaTeX formulas as fast as on paper. 

Sometimes you need to type a math formula fast and writing LaTeX seems like to much effort. To write a fraction in LaTeX you need to type
```
\frac{a}{b}
```
instead of just
```
a/b
```

Write `` \i `` for an integral

Write `` sq `` for square root

Write ``sin``, ``cos``, ``ln``, ``log`` instead of  ``\sin``, ``\cos``, ``\ln``, ``\log``


LiteLatexType handles this and many more problems allowing you to type LaTeX as fast as writing on paper.
